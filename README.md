# Pytorch Memory Efficient Attention with Learnable Attention bias
Implements Memory Efficient Attention in plain pytorch. Added support for (learnable!) biases. 
Warning: The introduction of learnable biases could slightly compromise the space complexity improvements of the original [memory efficient attention algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05682).
